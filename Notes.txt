-- TO DO --
find where for a segment variation winner winner different from overall. math is significantly different. 


backend:
what are the specific calls that I make for one instance. 
How many times do I expect in an hour. (Should we throttle this for once every 6 hours)
On average how much do you expect. 
In the app make so only 20-30 run simaltaneously. 
combo of throttling / day and x simeltaneously will help. 

api_token.py for tokens 



app engine remote api (account usage information)
How to get token 
nginx
flask
CTB
Check on Revenue, esp for older archived exp.

Archived Results 
	- How to deal with old tests CTB for revenue? ("-")
	- [DONE] How far back should we go (maybe just the last 50 tests)?
	- Threading 

Things to Check
	- Is the current form of authentication going to work? 
	- Should I have a timeout on if API call fails? Should I retry? 
	- If there is some sort of error, I should slash the report, and email myself
	

## Testing Velocity 




---- TODO ----

## Overall 
Archived Results 

## Experiment Stats 
# TODO SCENARIO WHERE THERE ARE LESS THAN 5 GOALS? 
# [DONE] Don't count scenarios where visitor count < 100 

## Segments
# [DONE] Ignore Segments that are only applicable to one test
# [DONE] Consider looking only at segment pairs that are in atleast 30% of experiments (Speeds things up a lot) + have over X number of visitors compared to the full experiment! 
# [DONE] Ignore experiments with a small number of visitors.

SORTING:
- Sort Experiments by Goal conversions that matter 

SUMMARY TO ADD:
- Status of Experiments by Project (Summary Page) 
- Start and End Date

EDGE CASES:
- Archived Results  

Next Steps
- Clean up code 
- Segments
- Start and End Date 



- Results over time  


Summary Statistics:
Number of Experiments ran
Number of Goals Tracked 


Successful Experiments: 
Take 5 most frequent goals
Show top 5 experiment variations with highest lift for these goals 
Show 5 experiment variations with lowest lift for these goals 
Must be atleast 5% difference. 



Segments: 
In order print given the following:
Segment Name Value Pair: Experiment Variation, Goal Name, Difference in Improvement, Improvment without the segment, Improvement with the segment 

Sort Criteria: 
Magnitide of Difference 
Highlight if its a top 5 goal

Top 3 segments and count of experiments where there is a deviation from mean.
